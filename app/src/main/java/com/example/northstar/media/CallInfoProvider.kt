/**
 * Holds the current incoming/active call, fed by [NorthstarNotificationListener] (which sees the
 * dialer's CATEGORY_CALL notification and its caller-name title). A process-wide singleton because
 * the listener is a system-instantiated service we can't hand a reference to — it pushes here, the
 * dash session observes [incomingCall].
 *
 * This deliberately avoids READ_PHONE_STATE / READ_CALL_LOG / READ_CONTACTS: the caller name we need
 * is already in the notification the system shows, and notification access is granted anyway for the
 * now-playing feature. The dash only ever DISPLAYS the call (Android can't answer/end it for us).
